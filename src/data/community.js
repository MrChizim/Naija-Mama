    body: "I've been going to LASUTH but the queues are honestly overwhelming. I'm 32 weeks now and considering switching. Has anyone used Reddington or any private hospital in Lagos? How was the experience? Need recommendations badly — my husband says I'm being dramatic but mama needs to be comfortable.",

    body: "I cannot explain what is happening to me. Since I entered second trimester, all I want is banga soup. My mother-in-law is already tired of making it. I asked my doctor and she just laughed. What are your weird cravings? Let's bond over this. Mine has to be: banga soup in the morning (yes, in the morning), banga soup for lunch, banga soup for dinner. My husband says I am a different person. Am I alone in this?",

    body: "My mother-in-law is convinced that eating eggs in the first trimester will cause my baby to be bald. She says it's 'what happened in her time'. My doctor says I NEED protein and eggs are excellent. I am stuck in the middle — I don't want to offend her but also I'm hungry and eggs are easy to make. Has anyone else been through this cultural clash? What did you do?",

    body: "I finally had my baby! 3.4kg baby girl after 18 hours of labour at LUTH. I want to share my full story because I wished someone had told me what to expect. The labour ward was busy but the nurses were amazing. When I thought I couldn't go on anymore, one nurse held my hand and prayed with me. I cried. My baby cried. Then we cried together. Full story in the comments — including what helped me through the long night, what I packed, and what I wished I'd known. You've got this, mamas.",

    body: "My mother brought agbo from our village when she came to help me. I didn't want to offend her so I kept it. Then I researched and found out that some of the herbs in common agbo preparations can cause contractions and have been linked to miscarriage. I poured it down the drain. When I explained to my mother with love, she understood. Please, Nigerian mamas, no matter how much you love your family traditions — check with your doctor before taking any local herb. The cultural knowledge our mothers have is beautiful, but some things weren't studied for pregnancy safety. Your baby comes first.",

I'm 6 weeks and I can barely keep water down. My doctor knows and is monitoring me. I just need community wisdom — what worked for you?",

She means well but her ideas about what the baby should eat, wear, sleep, and do differ wildly from what my paediatrician says. I want to share how I navigated this because I know many of you will face the same. The key: lead with gratitude, back everything with 'the doctor says', and pick your battles.
